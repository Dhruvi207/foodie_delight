I have created a online food ordering website landing page which is created by html css and little bit of javascript.
Javascript is only use for active navbar when user click on nav links it will heighlight which link he is interacting with.
I also use flexbox and grids in this page grids are used in menu section and flexbox is used in navbar, home section etc.
And this page is fully responsive it will open in desktop tab amd mobile also when it will open on mobile it's navbar will colapse and hamburger icon will be visible we can click on that icon and navigate navbar using that hamburger icon.
